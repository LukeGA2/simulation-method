Simulation is the real thing or a virtual process. 
Simulation to demonstrate the key features of selected physical or abstract system of systems. 
Simulation of key issues including 
effective access to information, 
key features and 
performance of selected 
applications approximation to simplify and assumptions, as well as the reproducibility and effectiveness Simulation. 
The simulation can be considered an external manifestation of the system to reproduce the special Simulation.

This is my draft thinking of simulation method and flow

Our simulation (dynamic simulation)


1. input data
  total demand number of use lift
  
  

2. generate random data (arrive time, floor, destination floor)
  includes:
  -normal data
  -traffic data
  
  
  
3. simulate use these random data and some specific setting
  for example,
  -simulation1: 2 lifts, capacity 10 people, these random number
  -simulation2: 3 lifts, capacity 12 people, these random number
  
  our simulate system, lift control, is similar to the realworld's lift running
  
  
  
4. get the useful data and show to user 
  data includes:
  average wait time, busy % , occupancy, wait queue length
  (this is for user to judgement which setting is better. The setting are lift number, lift capacity ) 


  for example:
  
                            2lifts, capacity 10       3lifts, capacity 12
                            
  average wait time:        20s                         10s
  busy %:                   80%                         65%
  occupancy:                9                           7                                        
  wait queue length:        12                          7
  
  
  
  The user will get useful information to help them determine the number of lifts and other type of lift.
